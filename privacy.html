            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Athlete Filters is a browser extension that helps you organize your Strava feed. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.</p>

            <h2>Data Collection</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not collect, transmit, or share any of your personal data.</strong> All data remains local to your browser.</p>

            <h3>What Data is Stored Locally</h3>
            <p>The extension stores the following information in your browser's local storage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Athlete Groups:</strong> The groups you create and the athletes you add to them</li>
                <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Your selected filter and display preferences</li>
                <li><strong>Athlete Information:</strong> Names and IDs of athletes from your Strava feed (obtained from public Strava pages you visit)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Local Storage Only</h3>
            <p>All data is stored exclusively in your browser using the browser's local storage API. This data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Never leaves your device</li>
                <li>Is never transmitted to any server</li>
                <li>Is never shared with third parties</li>
                <li>Remains under your complete control</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Permissions Explained</h2>
            <p>The extension requests the following permissions:</p>

            <h3>Storage Permission</h3>
            <p><strong>Why:</strong> To save your athlete groups and preferences locally in your browser</p>
            <p><strong>Data:</strong> Group names, athlete lists, and filter preferences</p>

            <h3>Strava.com Access</h3>
            <p><strong>Why:</strong> To read athlete information from Strava pages and add filtering controls to your feed</p>
            <p><strong>What we access:</strong> Publicly visible athlete names and IDs from pages you visit on Strava</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> We only read publicly available information that is already displayed on the page</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>This extension does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not use cookies beyond what your browser provides for local storage.</p>

            <h2>Data Export and Deletion</h2>
            <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Export:</strong> Use the "Export Data" feature in the extension to download your groups and settings as a JSON file</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Use the "Clear All Data" feature to permanently remove all stored information</li>
                <li><strong>Uninstall:</strong> Removing the extension will delete all stored data from your browser</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally in your browser and never transmitted, your information is as secure as your browser's local storage. We recommend:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep your browser up to date</li>
                <li>Use the export feature to back up your groups</li>
                <li>Be cautious when sharing exported JSON files as they contain your group configurations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Changes to Athletes on Strava</h2>
            <p>The extension only reads publicly available information from Strava. We do not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modify your Strava profile</li>
                <li>Post or comment on your behalf</li>

                <li>Access your password or authentication tokens</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This extension does not knowingly collect information from anyone under 13 years of age. The extension is designed for use with Strava, which requires users to be at least 13 years old.</p>

            <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
